# Rock-Paper-Scissor
A basic Rock Paper Scissor game, made for The Odin Project (Foundations) project 2.

This game is playable from the browser console. The project made me think and apply my knowledge of functions, parameterised functions, global and local variables, data passing, if-else logics and creating a random value. 

Also my Git skills and Cli skills are improving, ######slowly.
