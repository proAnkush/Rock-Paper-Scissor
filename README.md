# Rock-Paper-Scissor
A basic Rock Paper Scissor game, made for <b>The Odin Project</b> (Foundations) project 2.

This game is playable from the browser console. The project made me think and apply my (<b>javascript</b>) knowledge of functions, parameterised functions, global and local variables, data passing, if-else logics and creating a random value. 

`Also my Git and Cli skills are improving.`
